## World History/Underlying Narrative

<details><summary>World History/Underlying Narrative</summary>

  <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind every town is a Spirit Keeper. Spirit Keepers are responsible for ushering souls of
residents into the town through the Spirit Well. The size, location, and inhabitants of the town
are all decided by the Spirit Keeper. The key resident the Spirit Keeper chooses is the Innkeeper.
Innkeepers are the heart and soul of each community. The Innkeeper greets new arrivals and
helps them settle into their new home.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Innkeeper helps direct the Spirit Keeper along on their journey to fill the town and
discover themselves in the process. As the founders of each town, Spirit Keepers are
responsible for filling it with residents. Key citizen slots (merchant, gardener, metalsmith,
angler, etc) are listed on the “Town Log” and must be carefully filled. Residents can often
summon their friends and family into the town without needing the formality of the Spirit
Keeper.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To create a cozy, cohesive environment a “Request Ticket” system is used. A Request
Ticket is filled out with a spirit’s name and given to the Spirit Keeper for passage through the
Spirit Well and residency in the town. Request tickets are planted in the “Yard” of the Spirit
Keeper cave. Once planted, the Spirit Keeper can access all the information needed on how to
summon the spirit (the ticket is planted (buried) in a plot and a tombstone grows out displaying
a little info on the spirit – info is updated in the Spirit Keeper’s journal).
